                GSU ColorStack was founded in 2022 by a group of passionate computer science students who recognized 
                the need for greater representation and support for Black and Latinx students in tech fields.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Starting with just a handful of members, our chapter has grown to become a vibrant community 
                that offers mentorship, technical workshops, hackathons, and professional networking opportunities.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                As part of the national ColorStack organization, we're connected to a broader network of chapters 
                at universities across the country, allowing us to share resources and opportunities with our members.
